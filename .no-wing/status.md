# 🛫 no-wing Development Status

**Following our own service account principles to build no-wing**

## 📊 Identity Status

### ✅ Human Developer Identity
- **Name**: pchinjr
- **Role**: Architect & Strategic Decision Maker
- **Status**: Active
- **Recent Actions**: Complete architectural transformation
- **Commit Attribution**: `[HUMAN]` prefix established
- **Permissions**: Full (design, architecture, security, deployment)

### 🔄 Q Assistant Identity (Planned)
- **Name**: Q Assistant (no-wing)
- **Role**: Implementation & Testing
- **Status**: Awaiting service account creation
- **Service Account**: q-assistant-no-wing (not yet created)
- **Commit Attribution**: `[Q]` prefix planned
- **Permissions**: Implementation, testing, limited documentation

## 🔐 Security Model Implementation

### ✅ Identity Separation
- Clear role boundaries defined
- Human: strategy, Q: implementation
- Commit attribution system established

### ✅ Audit Trail
- Development audit log active
- All decisions documented with reasoning
- Clear tracking of who made what changes

### ✅ Principle of Least Privilege
- Each identity has specific, limited responsibilities
- Q will only get permissions needed for implementation
- Human retains architectural control

### ✅ Blast Radius Containment
- Q mistakes will only affect implementation
- Architecture and security remain human-controlled
- Easy rollback of Q changes

## 📋 Current Phase: Conceptual Framework ✅

### Completed
- [x] Applied service account principles to our own development
- [x] Established clear identity separation
- [x] Created audit trail system
- [x] Made first attributed commit following new model
- [x] Documented development security model

### Ready For
- [ ] Phase 1: Implement service account creation
- [ ] Create Q service account for no-wing project
- [ ] Q makes first commit to its own codebase
- [ ] Full meta-development: Q building Q

## 🎯 Meta-Development Achievement

**Status**: ✅ **Successfully using no-wing conceptual framework to build no-wing**

We are now:
- Following our own identity separation principles
- Using our own audit trail patterns  
- Applying our own security model
- Preparing for Q to develop its own capabilities

**Next Milestone**: Phase 1 implementation so Q can start committing to no-wing with its own identity.

---

**Meta-principle achieved**: The system is building itself using its own principles.
