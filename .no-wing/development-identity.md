# no-wing Development Identity

**Project**: no-wing (Q Service Account Manager)
**Development Approach**: Following our own service account principles

## üéØ Identity Separation Strategy

### Human Developer Identity
- **Name**: pchinjr
- **Role**: Architecture, design, strategic decisions
- **Commits**: Major features, architectural changes, documentation
- **Prefix**: `[HUMAN]` for clarity in commit history

### Future Q Assistant Identity  
- **Name**: Q Assistant (no-wing)
- **Role**: Implementation, testing, refinement
- **Commits**: Code generation, test creation, bug fixes
- **Prefix**: `[Q]` for clear attribution

## üîç Current Development Phase

**Phase**: Conceptual Framework Application
**Status**: Implementing service account principles in our own development
**Goal**: Prepare for Q to develop its own capabilities

## üìã Audit Trail Pattern

### Commit Attribution Rules
1. **Human commits** - Strategic decisions, architecture, requirements
2. **Q commits** (future) - Implementation, testing, optimization
3. **Clear prefixes** - Always identify the author type
4. **Detailed messages** - Explain the reasoning behind changes

### Development Security Model
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Each identity only does what it's designed for
- **Clear Boundaries**: Human designs, Q implements
- **Audit Everything**: Track who made what decisions and why

## üöÄ Implementation Strategy

### Immediate Actions
1. Apply clear commit attribution to all no-wing development
2. Document decision-making process
3. Prepare codebase for Q service account integration
4. Follow our own security principles

### Next Phase Preparation
- Structure code for Q to understand and modify
- Create clear interfaces for Q to implement
- Document patterns Q should follow
- Establish testing frameworks Q can use

**Meta-principle**: We are building the system that will build itself.**
