### What We Built
1. **Q Identity System** - Progressive capability tracking with automatic advancement
2. **Task Execution Engine** - Smart task analysis and capability level checking
3. **CLI Interface** - `q-task` and `q-status` commands for interaction
4. **Demo Lambda Function** - Realistic AWS service simulation
5. **Complete Happy Path** - 8-task progression from Observer → Partner
6. **Interactive Demo Script** - Video-ready demonstration

### Key Features Demonstrated
- ✅ Autonomous onboarding for human + AI teammate
- ✅ Progressive trust model (3 → 5 → 8+ successful tasks)
- ✅ Verifiable capability advancement with visual feedback
- ✅ Security-first approach with level-based permissions
- ✅ Realistic task simulation for each capability level
- ✅ Clear success criteria and advancement tracking

### Demo Flow
```bash
# 1. Initialize Q (Observer level)
no-wing init --name=DemoUser --repo=demo/project

# 2. Observer tasks (3 successful → Assistant)
no-wing q-task "analyze the Lambda function logs"
no-wing q-task "read function configuration info"  
no-wing q-task "check function performance metrics"

# 3. Assistant tasks (5 more successful → Partner)
no-wing q-task "update the Lambda function timeout"
no-wing q-task "modify the function memory allocation"
no-wing q-task "configure environment variables"
no-wing q-task "deploy configuration changes"
no-wing q-task "update function metadata"

# 4. Partner tasks (full capabilities)
no-wing q-task "create a new user authentication function"
no-wing q-task "build a data processing pipeline"
no-wing q-task "design a microservice architecture"

# 5. Check final status
no-wing q-status
```

### Ready for Production
The MVP successfully demonstrates the core value proposition with a concrete, verifiable happy path. Next steps would be:
- Real AWS integration
- GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Multi-environment support
- Team collaboration features
