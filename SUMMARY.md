# üéØ no-wing Project Summary

## What We Built

**no-wing** is an autonomous developer onboarding system that treats AI (Q) as a first-class development partner.

### Core Architecture
- **CLI Tool**: TypeScript-based command-line interface
- **Lambda Control Plane**: AWS Lambda functions for orchestrating onboarding
- **Progressive AI Capabilities**: Q starts as Observer, grows to Partner
- **Security-First Design**: Scoped IAM roles, audit trails, safeguards

### Key Components

#### CLI Interface (`src/cli/`)
- Main CLI with command routing and help system
- Init command for full onboarding orchestration
- Easter egg with Game of Thrones reference
- Interactive prompts and colorful output

#### Lambda Functions (`src/lambda/`)
- API handler for CLI communication
- Orchestrator for AWS resource provisioning
- IAM management for both human and AI
- GitHub integration with secrets and workflows

#### Q AI System (`src/q/`)
- Dialogue system for conversational interface
- Capabilities framework with progressive permissions
- Three-tier system: Observer ‚Üí Assistant ‚Üí Partner
- Security safeguards preventing permission escalation

#### Infrastructure Templates (`templates/`)
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment
- Dual authentication for human and Q roles
- Post-deployment analysis and monitoring

### Features Implemented

**For Developers**: Automated IAM role creation, local AWS CLI config, GitHub setup, Q teammate provisioning

**For Q (AI Agent)**: Dedicated IAM role, progressive permissions, audit trail, development workflow integration

**For Teams**: Consistent onboarding, security best practices, scalable architecture, compliance ready

### Commands Available

```bash
no-wing init --name=Paul --repo=pchinjr/my-project  # Main onboarding
no-wing nothing                                      # Easter egg
no-wing --help                                       # Help system
```

### Security Model

**Human Developer Role**: Environment-scoped permissions, external ID security, resource quotas, audit trail

**Q Agent Role**: Progressive capabilities (Observer ‚Üí Assistant ‚Üí Partner), cannot escalate permissions, comprehensive logging

### Project Metrics

- **15+ Files Created**: TypeScript source, configs, docs, templates
- **~1,500+ Lines of Code**: CLI, Lambda functions, Q system, tests
- **20+ Dependencies**: AWS SDK, GitHub API, Commander.js, TypeScript

### Next Steps

**Immediate**: AWS credentials setup, GitHub token config, Lambda deployment, first onboarding test

**Short Term**: Enhanced error handling, comprehensive tests, capability progression tracking

**Long Term**: Multi-team support, Q learning adaptation, advanced monitoring
