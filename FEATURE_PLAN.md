# Q Credential Separation Feature Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement credential separation between user identity and Q (no-wing) identity for AWS operations, ensuring clear audit trails and appropriate permission isolation.

## Goals
1. **Clear Identity Separation**: User actions vs Q actions are distinguishable in CloudTrail
2. **Secure Credential Management**: Q uses dedicated no-wing IAM credentials for deployments
3. **Consistent Tooling**: Same AWS CLI/SDK tools, different credential contexts
4. **Permission Elevation**: Built-in logic for Q to request/assume appropriate roles
5. **Audit Compliance**: Easy to trace who initiated what action

## Tasks and Verifiable Goals

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Tasks 1-3)
**Task 1: Credential Manager Implementation**
- [ ] Create `CredentialManager` class to handle credential switching
- [ ] Implement user credential detection and validation
- [ ] Implement no-wing credential loading from config
- [ ] Add credential context switching methods
- **Verifiable Goal**: `aws sts get-caller-identity` shows different identities based on context

**Task 2: AWS Client Factory**
- [ ] Create `AWSClientFactory` to provide context-aware AWS clients
- [ ] Implement client caching for performance
- [ ] Add automatic credential refresh logic
- [ ] Support for different AWS services (S3, CloudFormation, etc.)
- **Verifiable Goal**: Same code can use different credentials transparently

**Task 3: Configuration Management**
- [ ] Extend no-wing config to include credential settings
- [ ] Add validation for required IAM permissions
- [ ] Implement secure credential storage patterns
- [ ] Add configuration validation tests
- **Verifiable Goal**: Config validates no-wing IAM setup correctly

### Phase 2: Permission Management (Tasks 4-6)
**Task 4: Role Assumption Logic**
- [ ] Implement automatic role detection for common operations
- [ ] Add role assumption with session management
- [ ] Create fallback mechanisms for permission failures
- [ ] Add role caching to avoid repeated assumptions
- **Verifiable Goal**: Q can automatically assume deployment roles when needed

**Task 5: Permission Elevation System**
- [ ] Create permission request/approval workflow
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation when permissions are insufficient
- [ ] Add contextual error messages for permission failures
- [ ] Create permission learning system for future requests
- **Verifiable Goal**: Clear error messages with actionable next steps

**Task 6: Audit and Logging**
- [ ] Implement structured logging for all credential operations
- [ ] Add CloudTrail integration for audit trail verification
- [ ] Create audit report generation
- [ ] Add compliance checking utilities
- **Verifiable Goal**: All Q actions are clearly attributed in CloudTrail

### Phase 3: Integration and Testing (Tasks 7-9)
**Task 7: Deployment Integration**
- [ ] Integrate credential separation into existing deployment scripts
- [ ] Update CloudFormation deployment to use Q credentials
- [ ] Add deployment verification with proper identity attribution
- [ ] Create deployment rollback with audit trail
- **Verifiable Goal**: Deployments show Q identity in CloudTrail, user identity for initiation

**Task 8: CLI Integration**
- [ ] Update Q CLI commands to use credential separation
- [ ] Add credential status commands for debugging
- [ ] Implement credential switching commands for testing
- [ ] Add help text and documentation
- **Verifiable Goal**: CLI commands work seamlessly with new credential system

**Task 9: Testing and Validation**
- [ ] Create unit tests for credential management
- [ ] Add integration tests for AWS operations
- [ ] Create end-to-end deployment tests
- [ ] Add security validation tests
- **Verifiable Goal**: All tests pass and demonstrate proper credential separation

### Phase 4: Documentation and Deployment (Tasks 10-12)
**Task 10: Documentation**
- [ ] Update README with credential separation explanation
- [ ] Create setup guide for IAM configuration
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for permission issues
- [ ] Create security best practices documentation
- **Verifiable Goal**: New users can set up credential separation following docs

**Task 11: Migration Guide**
- [ ] Create migration script for existing installations
- [ ] Add backward compatibility for current setups
- [ ] Create validation script for proper configuration
- [ ] Add migration testing procedures
- **Verifiable Goal**: Existing users can migrate without losing functionality

**Task 12: Production Readiness**
- [ ] Add monitoring and alerting for credential issues
- [ ] Implement credential rotation procedures
- [ ] Add security scanning integration
- [ ] Create incident response procedures
- **Verifiable Goal**: System is production-ready with proper monitoring

## Success Criteria
1. **Identity Separation**: CloudTrail clearly shows user vs Q actions
2. **Security**: No overly permissive policies in production use
3. **Usability**: No change in user experience for common operations
4. **Auditability**: Easy to generate compliance reports
5. **Maintainability**: Clear code structure for future enhancements

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests with real AWS services
- End-to-end tests simulating user workflows
- Security tests validating permission boundaries
- Performance tests ensuring no significant overhead

## Rollout Plan
1. Feature branch development with frequent commits
2. Internal testing with test AWS account
3. Documentation and migration guide creation
4. Gradual rollout to existing users
5. Production deployment with monitoring

## Risk Mitigation
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Comprehensive testing before production deployment
- Clear rollback procedures if issues arise
- Monitoring and alerting for credential-related problems
