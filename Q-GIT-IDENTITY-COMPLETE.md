## 🛫 Ready for Production!

The Q Git identity system is **fully functional** and addresses the core concern:

**✅ SOLVED!** Q now has its own identity from the very beginning of usage, with automatic attribution and a complete audit trail.

### Demo Commands
```bash
# Check Q's Git status
npm run dev -- q-git-status

# See commit history with attribution
npm run dev -- q-history

# Make Q commit something (Partner level)
npm run dev -- q-task "create a new microservice"

# Verify the commit attribution
git log --oneline -3
```

**This is exactly what we needed for professional AI teammate integration!** 🎉
