# 🔄 no-wing Transition Summary

**From: Guardian Angel → To: Q Service Account Manager**

## 🎯 New Direction

**Problem Solved**: Q was masquerading as the user, creating security and attribution issues.

**Solution**: Give Q its own dedicated service account identity per project with:
- Local user account (`q-assistant-{project}`)
- Git identity (`Q Assistant ({project})`)
- AWS credentials (scoped IAM user)
- Isolated workspace and permissions

## 📋 What Was Accomplished

### ✅ Documentation Created
- **README.md** - New service account focused overview
- **MVP_ROADMAP.md** - 4-week implementation plan with prioritized tasks
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Technical architecture and security model
- **TRANSITION_SUMMARY.md** - This summary document

### ✅ CLI Commands Redesigned
- **setup** - Create Q service account for current project
- **status** - Show Q service account health and configuration
- **permissions** - Manage Q's AWS/git permissions
- **audit** - View Q's activity log with proper attribution
- **cleanup** - Remove Q service account and resources
- **launch** - Launch Q with service account identity

### ✅ Core Services Created
- **ProjectDetector** - Detect project type (SAM/CDK/Serverless) and generate Q config
- **ServiceAccountManager** - Manage Q service account lifecycle (create/status/cleanup)

### ✅ Old Code Removed
- Removed old "Guardian Angel" approach files
- Cleaned up context-passing logic that's no longer needed
- Updated package.json with new focus and dependencies

## 🚀 MVP Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1)
- [ ] Local user management (create Q user account)
- [ ] Git identity setup (Q commits with own identity)
- [ ] Project detection (SAM/CDK/Serverless)
- [ ] Basic CLI structure

### Phase 2: AWS Integration (Week 2)
- [ ] AWS identity management (IAM user for Q)
- [ ] Permission scoping (least privilege by project type)
- [ ] AWS CLI integration (Q uses own profile)

### Phase 3: Q Integration (Week 3)
- [ ] Q launch with service account identity
- [ ] Command execution as Q user
- [ ] Audit and monitoring

### Phase 4: Polish & Safety (Week 4)
- [ ] Safety features (emergency stop, rollback)
- [ ] User experience improvements
- [ ] Testing and validation

## 🔐 Security Benefits

### Before (Guardian Angel)
- ❌ Q commits as user
- ❌ Q uses user's AWS credentials
- ❌ No clear audit trail
- ❌ Security risk if Q compromised

### After (Service Account)
- ✅ Q commits with own identity
- ✅ Q uses scoped AWS credentials
- ✅ Clear audit trail of Q vs human actions
- ✅ Isolated blast radius per project

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The MVP will be complete when:
1. Developer runs `no-wing setup` in a project
2. Q service account is created with proper identity
3. Q can commit code with its own git identity
4. Q can deploy AWS resources with its own credentials
5. All Q actions are clearly attributed and auditable
6. Developer can run `no-wing cleanup` to remove Q service account

## 🚧 Next Steps

1. **Implement Phase 1** - Start with local user management and git identity
2. **Test Core Functionality** - Verify Q can operate with its own identity
3. **Add AWS Integration** - Create IAM users and scoped permissions
4. **Integrate with Q** - Launch Q process as service account user
5. **Polish and Document** - Add safety features and comprehensive docs

---

**The transformation is complete - no-wing is now focused on giving Q its own secure, auditable identity.**
