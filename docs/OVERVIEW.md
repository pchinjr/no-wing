# 📖 no-wing Documentation Overview

## 🎯 Documentation Philosophy

The no-wing project follows a **documentation-first** approach where:

- **Every architectural decision is recorded** in ADRs
- **Both human and AI perspectives** are considered
- **Documentation evolves with the code** through validation scripts
- **Clear structure** makes information easy to find

## 🏗️ Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Our ADRs capture the **why** behind important decisions:

### ADR-0001: Treat AI as First-Class Developer
**Status**: Accepted  
**Impact**: Foundational decision that shapes the entire system

This ADR establishes that Q (AI) gets:
- Its own IAM role and identity
- Progressive capability levels
- Separate audit trail
- Partnership status with humans

**Why this matters**: This decision differentiates no-wing from traditional tools and creates a framework for responsible AI integration.

## 🤖 AI-Inclusive Documentation

Since Q is a first-class developer, our documentation serves both audiences:

### For Human Developers
- Clear context and rationale
- Step-by-step implementation guides
- Security considerations
- Troubleshooting information

### For AI Agents (Q)
- Structured information for parsing
- Capability requirements clearly stated
- Permission boundaries defined
- Progression paths documented

## 📊 Documentation Quality

We maintain documentation quality through:

### Automated Validation
```bash
npm run validate-docs
```

Checks for:
- ✅ Required files present
- ✅ ADR numbering consistency
- ✅ Basic link validation
- ⚠️ TODO items tracking

### Review Process
- All documentation changes reviewed by team
- Q provides AI perspective on clarity
- Regular quarterly reviews for relevance
- Version control for all changes

## 🔄 Documentation Lifecycle

### 1. Creation
- New features require documentation
- ADRs for architectural decisions
- User guides for new capabilities

### 2. Review
- Team review including AI perspective
- Technical accuracy validation
- Clarity and completeness check

### 3. Maintenance
- Regular updates as code evolves
- Link validation and cleanup
- Outdated content archival

### 4. Evolution
- Documentation patterns improve over time
- Templates updated based on experience
- Process refinements documented

## 📈 Documentation Metrics

We track documentation health through:

- **Coverage**: All major features documented
- **Freshness**: Last update dates tracked
- **Quality**: Validation script results
- **Usage**: Which docs are accessed most
