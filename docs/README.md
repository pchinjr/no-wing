- **Single Source of Truth**: Main README.md contains all user-facing documentation
- **Technical Deep-Dives**: Separate files for complex technical implementations
- **Living Documentation**: Updated with each release
- **User-Focused**: Prioritize user needs over internal development details

**Previous Approach** (v0.1.x):
- Multiple documentation files with overlapping content
- Development-focused documentation mixed with user guides
- Historical roadmaps and implementation details
