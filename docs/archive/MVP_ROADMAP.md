  - ✅ Test: Q can make AWS API calls with own credentials

- ✅ **Permission Scoping**
  - ✅ Define project-specific permission sets by project type
  - ✅ SAM project permissions (Lambda, API Gateway, CloudFormation, S3, IAM)
  - ✅ CDK project permissions (PowerUser + additional IAM permissions)
  - ✅ Serverless project permissions (Lambda, API Gateway, Events, CloudFormation)
  - ✅ Generic project permissions (ReadOnly + basic deployment)
  - ✅ Apply least-privilege principle with inline policies

### ✅ P1 - Important - ALL COMPLETED
- ✅ **AWS CLI Integration**
  - ✅ Q uses its own AWS profile for all operations
  - ✅ Test: `aws sts get-caller-identity` shows Q's identity
  - ✅ Clear credential handling with user prompting and validation

## ✅ Phase 3: Q Integration (COMPLETED)

### ✅ P0 - Critical Path - ALL COMPLETED
- ✅ **Q Launch with Service Account**
  - ✅ Launch Q process as Q user (not current user)
  - ✅ Pass complete project context to Q with isolated workspace
  - ✅ Ensure Q uses its own credentials and identity
  - ✅ Test: Q operates entirely as service account

- ✅ **Command Execution**
  - ✅ Q executes all commands as its own user
  - ✅ Q commits use proper git identity
  - ✅ Q AWS operations use its own credentials
  - ✅ Test: Full workflow from Q suggestion to deployment

### ✅ P1 - Important - ALL COMPLETED
- ✅ **Audit and Monitoring**
  - ✅ Log all Q actions with timestamps and session tracking
  - ✅ Track Q's git commits separately with proper attribution
  - ✅ Monitor Q's AWS API usage through dedicated credentials
  - ✅ `no-wing audit` command to show Q activity with filtering options

## ✅ Phase 4: Polish & Safety (COMPLETED)

### ✅ P0 - Critical Path - ALL COMPLETED
- ✅ **Safety Features**
  - ✅ Graceful session termination functionality
  - ✅ Q permission management and cleanup
  - ✅ Workspace cleanup on errors
  - ✅ Complete resource cleanup with `no-wing cleanup`

- ✅ **User Experience**
  - ✅ Clear setup instructions and interactive prompts
  - ✅ Comprehensive status indicators for Q service account health
  - ✅ Helpful error messages and troubleshooting guidance
  - ✅ Complete documentation with examples and usage scenarios

### ✅ P1 - Important - ALL COMPLETED
- ✅ **Testing & Validation**
  - ✅ Comprehensive test suite with 118 tests passing
  - ✅ Security validation (Q operates in isolated environment)
  - ✅ Permission validation (Q has minimal required access)
  - ✅ Cross-platform compatibility (Linux focus)

## ✅ Testing Scenarios - ALL PASSING

### ✅ Core Functionality Tests
1. ✅ **Setup Test**: `no-wing setup` creates Q service account successfully
2. ✅ **Identity Test**: Q commits show proper attribution (not user's name)
3. ✅ **AWS Test**: Q deploys using its own AWS credentials
4. ✅ **Isolation Test**: Q operates in isolated workspace environment
5. ✅ **Cleanup Test**: `no-wing cleanup` removes all Q artifacts

### ✅ Security Tests
1. ✅ **Permission Test**: Q has project-specific scoped permissions
2. ✅ **Isolation Test**: Q user operates in dedicated environment
3. ✅ **Credential Test**: Q's AWS keys are separate from user's keys
4. ✅ **Audit Test**: All Q actions are properly logged and attributed

### ✅ Integration Tests
1. ✅ **Project Detection Test**: Correctly identifies SAM/CDK/Serverless/Generic projects
2. ✅ **Git Test**: Q can commit with proper attribution and identity
3. ✅ **Multi-Project Test**: Different projects have isolated Q identities
4. ✅ **Session Test**: Q sessions are properly managed and audited

## ✅ MVP Definition of Done - ACHIEVED

- ✅ Developer runs `no-wing setup` in any AWS project
- ✅ Q service account is created with complete identity (local user + git + AWS)
- ✅ Q can commit code with its own git identity (`Q Assistant (project)`)
- ✅ Q can deploy AWS resources with its own credentials
- ✅ All Q actions are clearly attributed and auditable
- ✅ Developer can run `no-wing cleanup` to remove Q service account
- ✅ Complete documentation covers setup, usage, and troubleshooting

## 🎉 MISSION ACCOMPLISHED

**no-wing MVP is complete and production-ready!**

### What We Built
- ✅ **Complete Q Identity Management** - Local user, git identity, AWS credentials
- ✅ **Smart Project Detection** - SAM, CDK, Serverless, Generic projects
- ✅ **Clear Credential Handling** - Bootstrap approach with user communication
- ✅ **Q Session Management** - Launch Q with complete identity isolation
- ✅ **Comprehensive Audit** - Full transparency and accountability
- ✅ **118 Tests Passing** - Production-ready reliability

### The Problem is Solved
- ❌ **Before**: Q masqueraded as human in git commits and AWS operations
- ✅ **After**: Q operates with its own complete identity - never masquerades again

- [ ] Global Q setup option across multiple projects
- [ ] Cross-project Q intelligence and learning
- [ ] Advanced permission management UI
- [ ] Q identity federation across teams
- [ ] Team Q management and collaboration
