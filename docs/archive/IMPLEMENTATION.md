# 🛫 no-wing Implementation Guide

**Complete technical documentation for the Q Service Account Manager**

## 🎯 Overview

no-wing is a production-ready Q service account manager that gives Amazon Q its own identity per project. It solves the fundamental problem of Q masquerading as human users by creating dedicated service accounts with complete identity separation.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
**Local user management and git identity setup**

#### ServiceAccountManager
- Creates dedicated local user accounts (`q-assistant-{project}`)
- Sets up home directory structure with proper permissions
- Configures git identity for Q commits
- Manages service account lifecycle (create, validate, cleanup)

#### ProjectDetector
- Detects project types: SAM (`template.yaml`), CDK (`cdk.json`), Serverless (`serverless.yml`), Generic
- Generates project-specific Q configuration
- Sanitizes project names for valid usernames
- Provides project-specific deployment commands

### Phase 2: AWS Integration
**AWS identity management with project-specific permissions**

#### AWSIdentityManager
- Creates IAM users with proper tagging and organization (`/no-wing/` path)
- Generates dedicated access keys for Q
- Sets up AWS profiles in Q's home directory
- Manages IAM user lifecycle with proper cleanup

#### PolicyGenerator
- **SAM Projects**: CloudFormation, Lambda, API Gateway, S3 + IAM role management
- **CDK Projects**: PowerUser access + additional IAM permissions for CDK operations
- **Serverless Projects**: Lambda, API Gateway, CloudFormation + Events/Scheduler
- **Generic Projects**: ReadOnly access + basic deployment permissions
- Generates both managed policies and inline policies for fine-grained control

#### CredentialManager
- Validates AWS credentials before operations
- Provides clear explanations of why credentials are needed
- Implements bootstrap approach (user credentials → Q credentials → Q independence)
- Offers comprehensive guidance when credentials are missing

### Phase 3: Q Integration
**Q session management with complete identity isolation**

#### QSessionManager
- Launches Q with complete service account context
- Creates isolated workspaces with project synchronization
- Manages session lifecycle with unique session IDs
- Provides comprehensive audit logging of all Q operations
- Handles graceful session termination and cleanup

#### Launch Command
- Validates service account health before launch
- Shows clear Q identity summary
- Provides security confirmation and explanation
- Manages active session detection and restart options
- Offers detailed feedback throughout the launch process

#### Audit Command
- Displays complete Q session history
- Provides session filtering and statistics
- Shows detailed session information (duration, exit codes, identity used)
- Offers verbose mode for technical details
- Tracks active vs completed sessions

## 🛡️ Security Model

### Identity Separation
```
🧑 Human User                    🤖 Q Assistant
├── Local user: your-username    ├── Local user: q-assistant-{project}
├── Git identity: Your Name      ├── Git identity: "Q Assistant ({project})"
├── AWS profile: your-profile    ├── AWS profile: q-assistant-{project}
└── Workspace: your-directory    └── Workspace: /home/q-assistant-{project}/workspace
```

### Bootstrap Approach
1. **Setup Phase**: User's AWS credentials create Q's IAM user
2. **Operation Phase**: Q uses its own AWS credentials exclusively
3. **Audit Phase**: Clear attribution of human vs Q actions

### Least Privilege
- Project-specific permission sets based on detected project type
- Minimal required permissions with ability to expand as needed
- Isolated blast radius per project
- Easy credential revocation and recreation

### Complete Audit Trail
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "event": "session_start",
  "sessionId": "q-abc123-def456",
  "user": "q-assistant-my-project",
  "project": "my-project",
  "gitIdentity": {
    "name": "Q Assistant (my-project)",
    "email": "q-assistant+my-project@no-wing.dev"
  },
  "awsProfile": "q-assistant-my-project"
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage: 118 Tests Passing
- **Project Detection**: SAM, CDK, Serverless, Generic project identification
- **Service Account Management**: User creation, configuration, cleanup
- **AWS Integration**: IAM user management, policy generation, credential handling
- **Q Session Management**: Session lifecycle, workspace isolation, audit logging
- **CLI Commands**: All command functionality and error handling

### Test Categories
1. **Unit Tests**: Individual service functionality
2. **Integration Tests**: Service interaction and data flow
3. **Security Tests**: Permission validation and isolation
4. **User Experience Tests**: CLI interaction and error handling

## 📊 Performance Characteristics

### Setup Time
- **Local user creation**: ~2-3 seconds
- **AWS IAM user creation**: ~5-10 seconds
- **Complete setup**: ~15-30 seconds depending on AWS latency

### Resource Usage
- **Disk space**: ~50MB per Q service account (home directory + workspace)
- **Memory**: Minimal overhead, Q sessions run as separate processes
- **Network**: Only during AWS API calls for setup/cleanup

### Scalability
- **Multiple projects**: Each project gets isolated Q identity
- **Concurrent sessions**: Supported with unique session IDs
- **Cleanup efficiency**: Complete resource removal in ~10-20 seconds

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Small, Focused Commits
The entire implementation was built using small, focused commits:

**Phase 1 (7 commits)**: Core infrastructure
**Phase 2 (8 commits)**: AWS integration  
**Phase 3 (5 commits)**: Q integration
**Credential Handling (4 commits)**: User communication

Each commit had a clear purpose and scope, making the development easy to follow and review.

### Testing-First Approach
- Every service has comprehensive test coverage
- Tests validate functionality without requiring actual AWS resources
- Focus on data structures, file operations, and user interaction patterns

### Documentation-Driven Development
- Clear documentation of each phase and component
- User-focused documentation with practical examples
- Technical documentation for maintainers and contributors
